# AGILE

This is the official codebase for **AGILE Platform: A Deep Learning-Powered Approach to Accelerate LNP Development for mRNA Delivery**.

## Introduction

AGILE (**A**I-**G**uided **I**onizable **L**ipid **E**ngineering) platform streamlines the iterative development of ionizable lipids, crucial components for LNP-mediated mRNA delivery. This platform brings forth three significant features: 

:test_tube: Efficient design and synthesis of combinatorial lipid libraries\
:brain: Comprehensive in silico lipid screening employing deep neural networks\
:dna: Adaptability to diverse cell lines

It also significantly truncates the timeline for new ionizable lipid development, reducing it from potential months or even years to weeks :stopwatch:ÔºÅ
